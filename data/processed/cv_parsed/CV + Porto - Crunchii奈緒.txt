BISA Beasiswa
App Project
This section highlights how I conduct a case
study, using BISA Beasiswa as the subject. It
covers user research, competitor analysis,
usability testing, wireframing, and prototyping to
create an effective design solution.
WWW.CRUNCHII.TECH
Background
Scholarship information is often scattered across multiple
sources, making it difficult for students to find relevant
opportunities. Existing platforms lack usability, with
limited filtering options and outdated listings. This study
aims to design a more accessible and user-friendly
scholarship platform.
The Problem
Students struggle with unclear eligibility criteria, missing
deadlines, and inefficient search tools on current
platforms. A streamlined system with better organization,
real-time updates, and personalized features is needed to
improve the scholarship search experience.
