GRAPHIC DESIGN
Dear Hiring Manager,
I am writing to express my interest in the Graphic Designer position at your
company. With a background in Information Systems and hands-on experience
in visual design, social media content, and educational media, I am confident in
my ability to contribute meaningfully to your creative team.
During the Kampus Mengajar program, I was trusted to design and manage the
visual content for our school s Instagram account. I created educational posts,
infographics, and interactive content to support student learning and showcase
school activities. This role not only developed my design skills but also taught
me the importance of consistency in branding and clarity in visual
communication.
Outside of that, I have contributed to various student-led events and campaigns
by producing promotional materials such as posters, certificates, and social
media graphics. I m comfortable using tools like Canva, Photoshop, Figma, and
CapCut for both static and short video content creation.
I may be early in my professional journey, but I approach every project with
dedication, willingness to learn, and strong attention to detail. I would be
honored to grow further while contributing to your team s creative goals.
Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to
discuss how my background and passion for design align with your company s
needs.
Sincerely,
Putri Vidia Lestari
