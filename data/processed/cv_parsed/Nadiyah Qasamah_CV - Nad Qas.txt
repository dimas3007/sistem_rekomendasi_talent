As an active 5th-semester student majoring in Informatics Engineering, I have a deep interest in data
management, database creation, statistics, and data administration. I am always eager to learn and explore
new developments in the field of technology. On campus, I am actively involved in various organizations
that have helped me develop my leadership, time management, communication, and teamwork skills. My
experiences include participating in a data visualization competition with a project titled '5G Network
Deployment,' serving as a facilitator for new students, and carrying the ceremonial tray at the 2024
graduation ceremony. I consistently strive to give my best in every task I undertake.
