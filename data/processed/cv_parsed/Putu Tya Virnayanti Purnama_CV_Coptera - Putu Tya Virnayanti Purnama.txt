PROFILE
I m a 6th semester student of Information Systems student at Brawijaya University who has an adaptive personality,
responsible, and enjoys building new relationships, working together, and learning new things. So far, I have
contributed in various positions in the organization, such as in the field of Student Advocacy and Welfare and
Secretariat and Spirituality. In addition, I had the opportunity to be a practicum assistant in the faculty for 1 year. I
have strong skills in administration, data management and recap, video content creation, research and analysis,
database fundamentals, structured modeling, and object-oriented modeling. In addition, I also have outstanding
abilities in leadership, cooperation, public relations, and marketing. I have career interests in administration or office
work, digital marketing (especially video content creation and copywriting), and IT, including roles as a data analyst,
business intelligence, or project manager. Through my participation in Coptera Carrer Virtual Internship, I m confident
in my ability to contribute meaningfully in my role as an event specialist intern. This program serves as a platform for
me to apply my knowledge and skills in real-world scenarios while supporting impactful and innovative projects. It
also acts as a stepping stone for my professional growth, enabling me to gain sustainable expertise and valuable
experience in these fields. I am also open to other career opportunities that can support my continuous professional
development.
