Summary
A fifth-semester Information Systems student at Universitas Budi Darma, I recently completed an
Independent Study Program focused on UI/UX Design at Startup Campus. Throughout the
program, I actively enhanced my design skills through hands-on projects, user research, and
prototyping, while also learning and practicing the Design Thinking methodology. I completed
various assignments and worked on a final project as a UX Researcher and Leader, where I was
responsible for identifying and analyzing user problems, creating personas and journey maps, and
conducting usability testing. Additionally, I contributed to the development of a design system and
UX copywriting, ensuring that the solutions provided were aligned with user needs. I am eager to
apply this knowledge in a professional setting and contribute to creating innovative and user-
centric digital solutions.Education.

insights into user needs and challenges. Based on this research, I developed detailed user personas
and user journey maps to guide the design process. Additionally, I designed a logo using Figma's
pen tools, created a comprehensive design system to ensure consistency across the interface, and
crafted UX copy to enhance the clarity and engagement of the user experience. To validate the
design's effectiveness, I conducted usability testing and iteratively refined the prototype based on
user feedback. These tasks allowed me to integrate both creative and analytical approaches,
ensuring that the final solution was user-centered, functional, and aligned with the project goals.
