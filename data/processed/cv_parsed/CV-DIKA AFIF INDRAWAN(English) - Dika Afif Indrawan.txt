ABOUT ME
I am a D3 Informatics Engineering student at Amikom University Yogyakarta with a strong interest in
UI/UX Design and web development. I have experience in designing applications and websites that focus
on solving user problems, and am proficient in using tools such as Figma. In addition, I have basic
knowledge in front-end (HTML, CSS, Boostrap, JavaScript) and back-end (PHP, MySQL) development
which allows me to understand the product development process thoroughly. I am interested in continuing
to develop my skills in UI/UX Design and contributing to a dynamic and innovative team.
