PROFILE
I am a recent Psychology graduate from Universitas Tarumanagara with a deep interest in human resources (HR), especially in HR
analysis, talent acquisition, learning & development. My internship experiences in HR analysis, public relations, and Integrated
Marketing Communications (IMC) have given me valuable exposure to human resources management, communication strategies, and
workplace culture initiatives. I have worked on projects related to HR analysis, public relations, and content creation, which have helped
me build skills in supporting a positive work environment. I am looking forward to applying my knowledge in organizational psychology
to contribute to human resources initiatives and further develop my career in this field.
